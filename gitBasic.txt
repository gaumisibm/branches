To upload any folder to github
1. check status of folder using "git status"
	if you get "fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git"
	then initialize with git init
2. git init will have success as "Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/gaurav1527/Desktop/Infosys_Internship/fullstack/.git/"

3. Now after initializing check "git status" and that should be 
	On branch master

	No commits yet

	Untracked files:
  	(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        client/
        server/
4. Now do git add . -> this will add all the files to the staging area

5. Now do git commit -m "Comment" -- this will commit all the changes
	suppose you have commited twice, thrice or more then you can see the hash of commit using git log
	this will log all the git change 

	commit 7cdccc12baf4487544f5f8ea7bd994a7be9c9680 (HEAD -> main)
	Author: Gaumis <kumargaurav1527@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu May 12 11:12:21 2022 +0530

   	 second commit

	commit 8d1ea11ed3c4a0fc8895f29fe4ddba60f11be409 (origin/main)
	Author: Gaumis <kumargaurav1527@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu May 12 10:50:32 2022 +0530

    	personal pc

	and using git checkout 7cdccc12baf4487544f5f8ea7bd994a7be9c9680(hash value of commit) 
	you can go back to the commit and you will have files from that time
	using this you can comeback to any other place.
	
	And if you will go "git checkout master", you will comeback to master branch where latest changes are there

6. Lets say you want to create one more branch where you will do random things and you don't want master branch to get affected
	create a new branch using "git branch NAME_OF_BRANCH"
	example - git branch dev
	and now if you do git branch	
	you will get two branches
	dev
	*(master)
	and in the newly created dev branch also you can create many branches and ask individual to work
	git checkout -b gaumis/multiply - this will create and checkout to new branch gaumis/multiply where
	I will write multiple logic and suppose someone else's(samartha) want to work on subtraction then 
	he too can create git checkout -b samartha/substract in dev branch and start working
 	and let's say that if we are convinced with gaurav development of multiply functionality
	then we want that code in dev branch too as it is now only in dev->gaumis/multiply branch
	then we'll first come to dev branch by git checkout dev and then we will merge code changes from gaumis/multiply
	using "git merge gaumis/multiply"

7. 	let's say you want to ignore some files from getting picked up in git
	then you can create a file named .gitignore and specify what all files you don't need to tracked by git

8. Now if you want to add any files/folder on github then do the following
	tell local pc about the address of remote 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/Gaumis/fullStack.git -> origin is the alias name for https address
	git branch -M master -> tell git where to push the code
	git push -u origin master -> this will upload code here.
	if you will write "git push" then also it will work
	here you have pushed master branch, now suppose you want to push dev branch
	then do the following
	git checkout dev
	git push -u origin dev or git push(as you are in dev branch)
